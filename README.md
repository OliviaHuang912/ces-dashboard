# Interactive Dashboard

This dashboard displays an interactive visualizations exploring the impact of Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation (CES) on pain and sleep outcomes. 

## Project Description

This flexdashboard includes:

- First page: A scatter plot showing the relationship between device usage time and pain score change (from baseline to 12 weeks). 

- Second page: A box plot displaying sleep quality over time by group

## Data Description

- Data Source: VA Office of Research and Development
- The study evaluates Cranial Electrical Stimulation (CES), a non-pharmacologic, FDA-approved therapy, in a randomized controlled trial of 50 Veterans with fibromyalgia who are aged 20 to 60 years. 
- Sample size: 47 participants after screening
- TRUE treatment group used Alpha-Stim device as the tool to provide cranial electrical stimulation (CES) therapy, while SHAM placebo group used CES device that does not deliver active electrical stimulation. 
- Key Variables: Defense Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS), sleep t-score, sex, ethnicity, age, usage time (hours), major life event, alcohol screener, group (TRUE and SHAM), and timepoint (baseline, 6 weeks and 12 weeks). DVPRS is graded on a scale of 0-10 (0 being "no pain" and 10 being "severe" or "worst pain").

## Dashboard Aims

- The primary objective of the study is to evaluate changes in clinical pain levels among subjects with fibromyalgia using the Defense Veterans Pain Rating Scale (DVPRS) at baseline, 6 weeks, and 12 weeks following treatment in both the SHAM and TRUE groups. 
- The secondary objective is to assess the device's effectiveness in improving sleep quality, sleep depth, and sleep restoration in both groups.

## Impact and Importance
This dashboard provides a visual summary of the effects of Cranial Electrotherapy Stimulation on pain and sleep outcomes among veterans. These findings may inform clinical decision-making and support the use of CES as a non-invasive therapy option.
